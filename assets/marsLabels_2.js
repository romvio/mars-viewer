Valles Marineris begins south of the equator in Tharsis region and stretches to the west. Compared to the Grand Canyon in Arizona, USA, Valles Marineris is approximately 10 times longer and five times deeper. The name is derived from the Mariner 9 orbiter, which discovered these canyons in 1971. The formation of Valles Marineris started around 4 billion years ago in the Noachian period. It is closely related to the origin of the Tharsis region, which consisted of three stages. In the first stage, volcanic activity and post-glacial rebound — in other words, rising land masses — were prominent. An increase in volcanic activity in Tharsis led to the creation of grabens due to added pressure on the crust, which subsided over time. These gigantic grabens are the canyons forming Valles Marineris. In the second stage, there was again an increase in volcanic activity, which resulted in the formation of fractures. Stage three was a period of forming shield volcanoes such as Olympus Mons.",
